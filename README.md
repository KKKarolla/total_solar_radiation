This project is a data visualization of the yearly total solar radiation in Hong Kong's King's Park from 1978 to 2025.

I obtained the CSV data file from the Hong Kong Observatory website and used it to create a dynamic art piece. The visualization shows a central cluster of jumping blue dots and pink, radiating wave lines around them, which looks like a fountain.

The image is dynamic and changes every two seconds with the year. The central blue dot cluster smoothly transitions based on the data for each year. At the same time, the surrounding waves rotate around the dots, and their shape also changes smoothly with the yearly data.
